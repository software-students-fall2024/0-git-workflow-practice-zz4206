[Top Game Development Trends in 2024 and Beyond.](./https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/top-game-development-trends-in-2024-and-beyond/#:~:text=Advancements%20in%20graphics%20rendering%20technologies,with%20games%20in%20new%20ways.)

The article says that AR and VR technologies are poised to redefine immersion in gaming, and AI-powered NPCs are becoming more and more common in games. I think a combination of two would create an incredible experience in the future. It also mentioned that there are advancements in AR/VR hardware, I do hope they can make the headset lighter in the future.

I think it'd be incredibly interesting to see VR and AI-powered NPCs combined to improve immersion even more for video games. Maybe by a few more years, we'll have games on a similar level as the one from the show Sword Art Online, where the NPCs feel fully like AI. I agree on the part about making headsets lighter, because as of current, they feel incredibly robust and users may tire out after an hour or two. In addition, I can't wait till the cost to build these technologies become cheaper so that these new headset devices and games will be more accessible.
